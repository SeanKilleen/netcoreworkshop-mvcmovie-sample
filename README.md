# NOTE: This is a copy of another repository!

I didn't create this work. We can thank Rick Anderson, Scott Hanselman, and Scott Guthrie for putting this sample app together.

I copied this project for use in our sample by referencing <https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetDocs/tree/master/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/sample/MvcMovie>

The repository in this case was meant as a tutorial for ASP.NET MVC 5. It's a great candidate because 1) it's well-done in the first place and 2) this version has not been ported to .NET Core.
